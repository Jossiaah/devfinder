# devfinder
devfinder is a mini web application that allows you to search the github rest api for github usernames. Search for a username and the results will bring back their name, bio, twitter username, blog/website, how many repos that develpoer has as well as followers and the number of people they are following. Results come back in a user-friendly mobile first approach.
